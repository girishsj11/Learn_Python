# Tuples(tuple)

## Differece between List & Tuples 

- List is mutable object & tuples are immutable objects
- We can only use tuples can be a set of keys in a dictionary , as because tuples are immutable & only immutable objects are hashed in dictionary.
- Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses (()) , lists are enclosed with square brackets([]).
- Sometimes you donâ€™t want data to be modified. If the values in the collection are meant to remain constant for the life of the program, using a tuple instead of a list guards against accidental modification.
- There is slight difference in indexing speed of list and tuple because tuples uses fewer pointers when indexing than that of list. Becuase of fewer pointers, acess mechanism is generally faster in tuples than lists.

    > Example 1
         
         #tuple creation
         from datetime import datetime
         start_time = datetime.now()
         t = (x for x in range(10000))
         end_time = datetime.now()
         print('Duration: {}'.format(end_time - start_time))
         
         
         #list creation
         from datetime import datetime
         start_time = datetime.now()
         l = [x for x in range(10000)]
         end_time = datetime.now()
         print('Duration: {}'.format(end_time - start_time))

## ***Program1.py***

  Program to find out the odd & even numbers from the list of numbers or range of numbers.
> Way1 : when the number is been anded with 1 (*binary) ,then if the LSB or last bit of element is 1 then it will be odd number, else even number.

> Way2 : when the number is been devided by 2 ,then if the gets remainder 1 then it will be odd number, else even number.
